# Getting Started With Symbols

The next step to replace a keyboard with voice commands is learning how to type special characters.  

Symbols look like this !@#$%^&)(][}{|+:;"'><?/\  (This list is not all of them on a standard keyboard, but enough to give you an idea.)  

Symbols are needed in order to punctuate sentences and to write programming languages. It's time to learn the names of Talon's symbols. 

This tutorial works best if you have a textarea to type into. You can do this tutorial in any text editor.  To use Talon's built in text editor, you can say the command **draft show**.  To hide the draft window say **draft hide**.  

The most important aspect of this walkthrough is to learn where to look up the commands for symbols.  There are two places these can be looked up.  The `help symbols` menu lists commands for individual characters.  The `help context symbols` menu lists common combinations of symbols.

# English Puncutation Characters  

Let's start with English punctuation characters. See what happens when you say `period` `comma` `exclamation point` `question` `colon` `semicolon`  into a textarea. 

It typed .,!?:; Say `select all` `delete` to delete what was just typed.

All of these commands and several alternates can be found on the `help symbols` menu.


# Parentheticals 

Now let's start with symbols for parenthetical clauses, which are also used a lot in programming. 

See what is typed when you say `inside parens`. 

The most common command I use to to insert parenthesis is `inside parens` and can be looked up on the last page of the `help context symbols` help menu.  It is different from the **help symbols** menu because the **help symbols** menu represents single symbols and the **help context symbols** menu is (mostly) common combinations of symbols.  Say `select all` `delete` to delete what was just typed.

See what happens when you say `left paren` `space` `right paren`
It is possible to type parentheses individually with `left paren` `L paren` `R paren` `right paren` and a few other commands you can look up with the `help symbols` menu.

Say `select all` `delete` to delete what was just typed.


# Characters to Add Quotation Marks: 

Now let's do some quotation symbols. 

See what happens when you say `empty string` `go way right` `space` `empty dubstring`.
Say `select all` `delete` to delete what was just typed.

Quotes are usually added added in pairs. So the commands to add quotes in pairs are very useful. **Empty string** is the command for pairs of single quotes, and **empty dubstring** is the command for pairs of double quotes. Those come from the **help context symbols** menu. 
Commands for individual symbols include `quote`, `double quote`, and `apostrophe` and those can be found on the **help symbols** menu.  
Say `select all` `delete` to delete what was just typed.


# Math Symbols: 

Now let's do a collection of symbols normally used for math.  
See what happens when you say `plus` `minus` `slash` `star`.
You can say `plus`  for "+", `minus` or `dash` for the -, `slash` or `forward slash` for division, `star` or `asterisk` \* for multiplication, all of which are found in the `help symbols` menu. Say `select all` `delete` to delete what was just typed.

See what happens when you say `equals` `less than` `greater than`.

The `equals` for is for the equals sign, `left angle` or `less than` is for the less than sign, `right angle` or `greater than` for is for the greater than sign, all of which are found in the `help symbols` menu. Say `select all` `delete` to delete what was just typed.



# Brackets and Braces

See what happens when you say `inside parens`  `inside squares`  `inside braces`.

Brackets and braces are essential to programming, and they come in pairs.  `inside parens` for (), `inside squares` for [], `inside braces` for {}, which can all be seen on the `help context symbols` menu. 

Once you start using the inside commands, you are going to want to learn the arrow key commands.  `go left` will move the cursor one character left. `go right` will move the cursor one character right.  If you have lines, **go up** will move the cursor one character up, and **go down** will move the cursor one character down.


It's also possible to type out the characters individually. `left square` for "[", and `right square` for "]", `left brace` for "{" and `right brace` for "}" can all be seen on the `help symbols` menu.  And again, `left paren` types "("  and `right paren` types ")".

Say `select all` `delete` to delete what was just typed.


# Symbols from The Number Row:

There are also a lot of other symbols that are found on the number row of the keyboard. 

See what happens when you say `back tick` `tilde` (pronounced TILL day) `at sign` `hash` `dollar sign` `percent` `caret` `ampersand` (pronounced AMP er sand)


You should see \`  for the backtick symbol, `~`   for the tilde sign `@` for the at sign, `hash` for #, `dollar sign` for $, all of which can be found in `help symbols`.  

You should see also see `percent` for %, `caret` for ^, `ampersand` for &, all of which are found in the `help symbols` menu.

Say `select all` `delete` to delete what was just typed.

# The Rest: 

And there are a few other symbols on the keyboard that we have not covered. See what happens when you say `underscore` `pipe` `backslash`. 

You should see `\_`  for the underscore sign, `pipe` for |, and `backslash` for \, all of which can be found in the `help symbols` menu. 

Say `select all` `delete` to delete what was just typed.

Congrats!  If you have been using the Talon draft window, you can close it with the command **draft hide**.  You now know how to press all the symbol keys on a standard United States keyboard, how to access the `help symbols` menu to look up symbols, and how to access the `help context symbols` menu to to look up common symbol combinations.  

Congratulate yourself on finishing this walkthrough!
