# Replacing Mousing With The Dense Mouse Grid

This is [my (Tara Roys's)](ko-fi.com/ataraxy's) walkthrough for getting started with the Dense Mouse Grid.  The Dense Mouse Grid is a talom script set invented by timotimo and Aegis and heavily refined and documented by myself to allow you to use voice commands to put your mouse pointer anywhere you want on the screen.  It is my (Tara Roys's) favorite way to mouse. 

The Dense Mouse Grid has three adantages: it allows me to easily mouse without hands, it doesn't cost over $200 for a Tobii 5 eyetracker, and it has a lot of customizability.  This is how I do mousing for work and for games that don't need fast reflexes. `next step`

Open your favorite browser.  For example, I would do it by saying **launch firefox**.  If your cursor is not already on the address bar, go to the address bar wth the command `go address` 

Here are the commands to spell out the webaddress for the dense mouse grid, github.com/tararoys/dense-mouse-grid.  `gust` `sit` `trap` `harp` `urge` `bat` `dot com` `slash` `trap` `air` `red` `air` `red` `odd` `yank` `sun` `slash` `kebab dense mouse grid over`  Then press `enter`.


If your hands work a little,  use them to click the green code button.  If your hands don't work at all, there are two ways to get to the green button using knausj commands.  

Say the command `tab thirty third.` This command simulates pressing the tab button thirty three times,  which will skip through available links until it gets to the link that is the code button. `next step`  You have to say *thirty-third* and not thirty three because the ending of the word third is what tells it to repeat the command thirty three times.

Alternatively, the knausj script has a built-in mouse grid.  Say 'mouse grid' to bring up the grid. Then use the numbers to pick regions that have the green button in it.  The numbers will 'zoom' your mouse more and more accurately towards the green button.  Two zoom levels in, the mouse grid will show the zoom in the center of the screen, so be aware of that.  

When the zoom is positioned over the green button, say 'touch.'  The green button will be clicked and the mouse grid will close iteself.  

If those commands overshoot the code button, saying **shift tab** will go one link backward on the page. If that command undershoots the code button, saying  **tab** will skip to the next link on the page.  Navigating with the tab key this way is one way to go through a webpage. Once the green button is higlighted, saying `enter` will open the drop down menu.  

Say `tab sixth` to highlight the link _Download Zip_.  Say `enter` to start downloading the code. 

Most browsers will ask you what you want to do with the file.  On windows, Firefox pops up a window saying "What should Firefox do with this file?" 

Since, at this point, my Talon installation does not have a mouse, I want to do the thing that means I don't need hands.  I choose the _Open With Windows Explorer_ option.  This is not the default option, so I need to say `go up` to highlight the option.  

Then I say `tab` a couple of times until the _ok_ button is highlighted, and then I say `enter.`  This process will differ on different operating systems and different browsers.

This will bring up the Windows file explorer, which will have one folder in it saying _dense mouse grid_.  Say `go down` to highlight that folder.  To bring up the right click menu for the folder, say `shift f ten`.  To highlight the copy option, say `go down third`, then to select it say `enter`.  This copies that folder to the system clipboard.  

Now it's time to go to put this folder into the Talon user directory.  To go to the Talon user directory I say `go talon user`. This will skip directly to the Talon user directory.  Then, to simulate the **ctrl v** paste keyboard shortcut, I say `control vest` and that pastes the _dense mouse grid_  folder from the system clipboard into the Talon user directory.

The dense mouse grid is now installed and is ready for use! `next step.`

## Using The Dense Mouse Grid

The Dense Mouse Grid is a screen coordinate overlay.  To use the Dense Mouse Grid, say `dense grid`. 

The screen is divided into big numbered squares, and each numbered square is divided into twenty-six rows and twenty-six columns, each labeled with a letter from the Talon phonetic alphabet. `next step`

To move the mouse pointer, you say a number, like `two`, and then a row name, like `quench`, and then a column name, like `harp.`  

This moves the pointer to square 2, row q, column h.  `next step.`  

These commands can be said in any order- you can say a number, then a letter, then a letter, a letter, a number, and another letter. You can say thing slowly, letter by letter, or quickly, skipping all of the helper visualizations.  

If you have chosen a row, but do not want that row, you can also choose a different row with the command **horizontal** and the letter name.  For example, if you have row drum selected, you can change it to row pit with the command `horizontal pit`. 

To click with the mouse pointer, say `touch`. To double-click with the mouse pointer, say `duke.`

The mouse grid stays up by default, and to make it disappear, say `grid close.`  

To bring it back, say `dense grid`  

## Visual optons

The dense mouse grid has a lot of flexibility.  To make it smaller, say `smaller grid.`  To make it bigger, say `bigger grid.`  The changes will stay after you say `grid close` and `dense grid`, but they will reset to defaults if Talon is restarted.  

To make the background more visible, say `darker background`.  To make the background less visible, say `lighter background`.  

To make the letters more visible, say `darker letters`.  To make the letters less visible, say `lighter letters`.

## Window Options and Multiple Screen Options

To overlay on just a single window, click on the window and say `dense grid win.` 

To use the overlay on a different monitor, choose the number of your monitor.  For exampe, say `dense grid screen 2` to overlay your second monitor.

## Layout options

The dense mouse grid has 4 layout options.  To put single letters in frames around the numbers, say `frame grid`.  To put a checkerboard pattern across everything, say `checker grid`.  To see all of the coordinatess, say `full grid.`  To return to the defaul option, say `phonetic grid`.

I am particularly proud of designing phonetic grid, since it means I no longer have to think and remember the names of the talon letters.  I can simply read them.  The words will automatically change if you change your default alphabet as well.  

## Looking Things Up

To review the commands for the dense mouse grid, you can look up the commands for opening the grid with the command `help context full mouse grid`,  you cand look up the command for using the grid with the commands `help context full mouse grid open`, or you can say `help context` and navigate to the full mouse grid open options.  


## Customization options

All off the colors and many of the defaults are customizable in a settings file.  I can use my newly-installed dense mouse grid to open the file and edit a setting.  

To open the file, do the following.  To open the windows file explorer, say `launch explorer.`  To go to the Talon user directory, say `go talon user`.  Then say `dense grid` to turn on the mouse grid.  

Position the mouse over the folder dense-mouse-grid.  Say `duke` to open it.  Then position the mouse over the folder dense\_mouse\_grid.  (Sorry about the names).  Say `duke` to open it again.  

Position the mouse over full\_mouse\_settings.talon.  Say `righty` to bring up the right-click menu.  Position the mouse over _open with_.  When the menu pops up, position the mouse over notepad.  To open the file in notepad, say `touch` 

Instead of bothering to explain how hexadecimal coloers work, I'm instead going to tell you how to quickly look them up.  Hexadecimal color codes are so popular that thousands of graphic designers have made their lives easier by posting which colors go with which codes on the internet, so it's a matter of googling.  


Say `launch firefox` (or say 'launch' and whatever browser you like.)  Say `go address` to go to the address bar.  Then, you can either use the Talon Phontic alphabet to spell out the website contrastchecker.com, or use the commands `smash contrast checker over` `dot com` then press `enter`

This takes us to a color contrast checker, a tool for designers specializing in accessibility (and people who like us want to change the colors on their mouse grid). It  can be used to find good, accessible color combinations.  Using the newly installed dense mouse grid, you can click on the forgrond color and background color tools.  

For dragging sliders, you can use the drag command.  Start dragging with the `drag` command, and reposition the mouse.  To stop dragging, say `touch.`  

Once you have found colors you like, you can copy six digit hexadecimal color codes from the website to their place in the settings.  The hex color codes are the six digit combinations of letters and numbers.  For example an atractive blue color is represented by the hex code 3b62c4.


Once you've copied a color code (which you can do by highlighting it by dragging with the mouse, using `bigger grid` and `smaller grid` to give you the degree of detail you need, and saying `control cap` to copy it), you can use the mouse to go back to Notepad and our settings file, full\_mouse\_settings.talon.  

Then find the setting user.full\_mouse\_grid\_letters\_background\_color, look to the left of the equals sign, and replace the numbers in the double quotes with 3b62c4.

The quotes are important in this case, so don't try to put the numbers without them.

Save your work with the keyboard shortcut ctrl-s.  You might have noticed throughout this walthrough that I have been using keyboard shortcuts, except as voice commands.  To press ctrl-s I say `control sun`.

All other options can be similarly changed.  This grid currently supports changing all the colors, changing fonts, changing the default size the grid starts out at, and changing the default mode the grid starts in.  All of these can be changed in full\_mouse\_settings.talon.

Congratulations!  You now have all the power of a mouse at the tip of your tongue!
