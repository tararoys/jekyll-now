# Keyboard Shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts are way of doing a particular action without using the mouse to click on the user interface. 

One of the most common keyboard shortcuts is 'ctrl-s'.  Ctrl-s is widely used to save the document you are working on.  

Talon can simulate pressing the 'ctrl' key with the voice command *control*, and the s key with the voice command *sun*.  To press the keyboard shortcut ctrl-s, you say `control sun`. 

Keyboard shortcuts rely on modifier keys.   There are four main modifier keys on a Windows keyboard. They are the shift key, the ctrl key, the alt key, and the Windows key.  

The Talon knausj names for each modifier key are `control` for ctrl, `shift` for shift, `alt` for alt, and `super` for Windows. Pressing them on their own does not do anything, and Talon knausj is not set up to press them on their own.

The names of the modifer keys can be accessed by saying `help modifiers`.  

To press any keyboard shortcut, translate the shortcut keys to their knausj Talon equivalents and say them out loud. 

A good excercize using keyboard shortucuts is window management.  

To access the app switcher, you can simulate pressing the keyboard shortcut alt-control-tab by saying `alt control tab`.  Press `escape` to leave the app switcher or `enter` to pick a particular app. 

To access the Task View, a very advanced windows switcher, press the windows-tab keyboard shortcut with the command `super tab.` To leave the Task View,  either press `escape` or select an app with `enter`.

To pick a particular app on the windows task bar, pressing the windows key and the number of the app on the bar will open it.  For example, the keyboard shortcut *windows-1* will select the first app.  Saying `super one` will have Talon simulate pressing *windows-1*.  

To minimize all windows, one can press the keyboard shortcut *windows-m.*  To simulate this keyboard shortcut with a Talon command, say `super made`. To restore all windows minimized, use the keyboard shortcut shift-windows-m, or, in Talon, `shift super made`.

Keyboard shortcuts are traditionally one way to make things easier and faster, and the fact that Talon makes them all available by voice makes them even more accessible.
