In theory, Talon can be set up so
that you can treat it- and your computer
like a giant robo-phone call with
voice activated menu options.

How can you get it to do so in 
practice?

First, let's talk iformation. 
Specifically, where do you find
it?

## Windows + NVDA

If you are settig up on a Windows
computer, you want to use NVDA.
(I think JAWS is a thing you can
use too but i don't have JAWS)

There will be two major sources
of information you'll want to
sign up for to troublshoot this
setup:

[The Talon slack for Talon troubleshooting](https://talonvoice.com/chat)
[The NVDA forum and mailing list for NVDA troubleshooting](https://nvda.groups.io/g/nvda)

The other main sorce of info is [me (Tara Roys)] 
and to access that, it's $25 per hour to pick my 
brain and ask questions about code I've written
and possible solutions, or $100/hr 
if I actually have to program somethig myself.  
(I hate programming, but can occasionally be 
bribed to do it.)
