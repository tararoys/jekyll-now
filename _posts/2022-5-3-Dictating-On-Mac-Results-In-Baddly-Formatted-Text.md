title: Fix Talon Mac Dictation By Disabling Mac's Add Period With Double Space Setting 
---

On Macs, sometimes the `say` and `phrase` or dictation mode commands command result in a dictated phrase thaat has random periods and bad formatting inserted into it.  

For example, saying: 

    say why is my text not working 

Might result in 

    Why is. my.textnot working 

This is due to a Mac setting.  To fix the problem, go to System Preferences, select keyboard, select Text, and disable 'add period with double space' in the top right of the window.
