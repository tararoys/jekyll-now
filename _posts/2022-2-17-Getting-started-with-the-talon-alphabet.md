Learning to spell things with the Talon alphabet commands is a good way to start learning Talon.  By the end of this tutorial, it's important to know one voice command: the `help alphabet` command, to bring up the Talon alphabet popup window. With that  command, you can  look up every other letter command. To close this popup, you say `help close`.

# Capitalizing Letters

In order to capitalize letters, use the shift key. The command for shift key can be looked up with the **help modifier** command.  

In order to write the capital A, say `shift air`, and in order to write a capital B, say `shift bat`, and so on for all the letters of the alphbabet.  

<div>practice here: <span style = "border: solid black 2px; min-width: 100px; display: inline-block " class= "textarea" contenteditable = true>   </span></div>

In order to spell out Talon, say `shift trap` `air` `look` `odd` `near`.

<div>practice here: <span style = "border: solid black 2px; min-width: 100px; display: inline-block " class= "textarea" contenteditable = true>   </span></div>

One error you might encounter is that there is a command called ship which capitalizes every letter.  TALON is the result of saying `ship trap air look odd near`

You can clear your text editor by saying **select all** and **delete** 

# Numbers 

Numbers in Talon are simple.  
If I say `one` it will type 1 and if I say `two` it will type 2.

<div>practice here: <span style = "border: solid black 2px; min-width: 100px; display: inline-block " class= "textarea" contenteditable = true>   </span></div>

If I say `five thousand three hundred and sixty` it will type 5360. 

<div>practice here: <span style = "border: solid black 2px; min-width: 100px; display: inline-block " class= "textarea" contenteditable = true>   </span></div>

If I say `one two three four five` it will type 12345.

<div>practice here: <span style = "border: solid black 2px; min-width: 100px; display: inline-block " class= "textarea" contenteditable = true>   </span></div>

Try typing 123456789 

<div>practice here: <span style = "border: solid black 2px; min-width: 100px; display: inline-block " class= "textarea" contenteditable = true>   </span></div>

You can clear your text editor by saying **select all** and **delete.**  If you are using a Talon draft window, you can close it by saying **draft hide**.
