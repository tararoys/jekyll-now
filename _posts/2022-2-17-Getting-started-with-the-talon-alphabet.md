Learning to spell things with the Talon alphabet commands is a good way to start learning Talon.  By the end of this tutorial, it's important to know one voice command: the `help alphabet` command, to bring up the Talon alphabet popup window. With that  command, you can  look up every other letter command. To close this popup, you say `help close`.


Additionally, the `help special keys` command will bring up a menu of other keyboard keys which include the **space** and **delete** keys so you can look up those commands.

Open any text editing program you want to do this tutorial.  Any editor will work. Get rid of the draft editor with the command **draft hide**. 

# Learning The Alphabet Piece By Piece

# Capitalizing Letters

In order to capitalize letters, use the shift key. The command for shift key can be looked up with the **help modifier** command.  

In order to write the capital A, say `shift air`, and in order to write a capital B, say `shift bat`, and so on for all the letters of the alphbabet.  

<div>practice here: <span style = "border: solid black 2px; min-width: 100px; display: inline-block " class= "textarea" contenteditable = true>   </span></div>

In order to spell out Talon, say `shift trap` `air` `look` `odd` `near`.

<div>practice here: <span style = "border: solid black 2px; min-width: 100px; display: inline-block " class= "textarea" contenteditable = true>   </span></div>

One error you might encounter is that there is a command called ship which capitalizes every letter.  TALON is the result of saying `ship trap air look odd near`

If I say `one` it will type 1 and if I say `two` it will type 2.
