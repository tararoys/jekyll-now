Learning to spell things with the Talon alphabet commands is a good way to start learning Talon.  By the end of this tutorial, it's important to know one voice command: the `help alphabet` command, to bring up the Talon alphabet pop up window. With that  command, you can  look up every other letter command. To close this popup, you say `help close`.


Additionally, the `help special keys`  command will bring up a menu of other keyboard keys which include the **space** and **delete** keys so you can look up those commands.
Open any text editing program you want to do this tutorial. Talon has a built in text editor called the Talon Draft window that you can open with the command **draft show**, but any editor will work. Get rid of the draft editor with the command **draft hide** `next step`
